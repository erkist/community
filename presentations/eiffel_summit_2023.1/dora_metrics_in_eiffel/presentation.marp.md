# What is Eiffel?

#### And why should I care?

---
# The era of small-scale software is over

<!-- First, I would like to make a proclamation: The era of small-scale software is over.
It feels like wherever you look, on your phone, on your computer, in your home, at work and in society, most software is part of a much larger system.

The apps on your phone are often connected to the cloud. So are the applications on your computer. Maybe you have home-automation at home. Work can often be done just as easily outside the office as in the office. Your car might be connected 24/7 to receive updates and provide services. Government e-services are often connected together.

This doesn't mean that there is no small-scale software being developed, but I would say that most of what people are excited about is not stand-alone small-scale software. It is massive systems of connected parts. It is IoT + apps + cloud + AI + a lot of other stuff.

This puts a lot of weight on development processes and flows. For one, there are a lot of components that need to work together, but also there are a lot of different process that need to work together. Developing and releasing firmware for a hardware IoT device and building and deploying a performance tweak to a cloud service just ain't the same.

One thing that really helps is having a common language, and that is what we will be talking about today.
